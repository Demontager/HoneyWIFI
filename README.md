Wi-Fi access point for pentest purposes

Bash shell script to create simple open WIFI network and reveal entered WPA passwords.
Basically it made to test "people awareness" against supplying their valid passwords to unauthorized 3-rd party WiFI Access Points.
I got this idea from "Linset" pentesting suite and just simplified few things.

Tested on Xubuntu 14.04, on any Debian based distros should work as well.
